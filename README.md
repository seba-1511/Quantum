# Quantum

This repository contains my code and experiments for my research on quantum computing as a student at ISI, under the advisement of Dr. Itay Hen. It contains the following:

#### simulatedAnnealing/
Several implementations of the simulated annealing, some of them with a basic grid search procedure. A version is based on the schedule found by Dr. Albash. The goal was to solve planted instances as fast as possible. 

#### quantumAnnealing/
The implementation of a quantum annealer, to solve the same kind of problems as with simulated annealing.
